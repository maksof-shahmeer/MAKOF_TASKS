<!-- Description
Edit
You are given an array of objects representing transactions. Each transaction object has the following properties: id (a
unique identifier), amount (a numeric value), and type (either "credit" or "debit"). Write a JavaScript function that
uses the reduce method to calculate the net balance of all transactions. The net balance is the sum of all credit
amounts minus the sum of all debit amounts.

Your function should return an object with two properties: totalCredit and totalDebit, representing the total credit
amount and total debit amount respectively.

const transactions = [
{ id: 1, amount: 100, type: "credit" },
{ id: 2, amount: 50, type: "debit" },
{ id: 3, amount: 75, type: "credit" },
{ id: 4, amount: 30, type: "debit" },
{ id: 5, amount: 200, type: "credit" }
];

OUTPUT:
{ totalCredit: 375, totalDebit: 80 } -->
